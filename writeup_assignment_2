In this assignment, I explored data regarding credit information of individuals. 
Carried out logistic regression, and exploratory data analysis to ascertain a link between the variable, SeriousDlqin2yrs,
  i.e. 'Person experienced 90 days past due delinquency or worse', and other variables in the dataset. 
  
Using accuracy as a metric for evaluation, found an approximately 84% accuracy using the 10 best features, 
  compared to an 83.9% baseline.
